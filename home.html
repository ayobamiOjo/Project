            <p>Ayobami Esther Ojo is a young Nigerian student who is curious about the world. She came to Canada to help expand her knowledge.</p>
            <p>She graduated from Good Shepherd Schools in Ogun State, Nigeria. She attended York University for a few years to study computer science
                 before going to get a professional diploma in DevOps and Cloud Engineering at Landmark Technologies.</p>
                  <p>Her favorite thing to do is to listen to music and watch some comedy videos. <em>You can click on the links to check them out.</em></p>

            <p>Surprisingly, her role model was Ben Carson, after reading his book on gifted hands. She was motivated by how he was able to overcome challenges around him. 
                This helped encourage her in so many things, including her eagerness to learn something new every day.</p>
            <p>Her two favorite quotes are: "Success is determined not by whether or not you face obstacles, but by your reaction to them. 
                And if you look at these obstacles as a containing fence, they become your excuse for failure." and "Do your best and let God do the rest." After learning about the world of programming in 2018, 
                she decided to explore more about it and even pursue a career in it.</p>
